# About
The challenge is to program a simple version of the game Battleships. Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.

The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

· 1x Battleship (5 squares)

· 2x Destroyers (4 squares)


The player enters coordinates of the form “A5”, where "A" is the column and "5" is the row, to specify a square to target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.

You can write a console application or UI to complete the task.

Try to code the challenge as you would approach any typical work task; we are not looking for you to show knowledge of frameworks or unusual programming language features. Most importantly, keep it simple.
